.SH NAME
fzf - a command-line fuzzy finder

.SH SYNOPSIS
fzf [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS Search mode
.TP
.B "-x, --extended"
Extended-search mode
.TP
.B "-e, --extended-exact"
Extended-search mode (exact match)
.TP
.B "-i"
Case-insensitive match (default: smart-case match)
.TP
.B "+i"
Case-sensitive match
.TP
.BI "-n, --nth=" "N[,..]"
Comma-separated list of field index expressions for limiting search scope.
See \fBFIELD INDEX EXPRESSION\fR for details.
.TP
.BI "--with-nth=" "N[,..]"
Transform the item using the list of index expressions for search
.TP
.BI "-d, --delimiter=" "STR"
Field delimiter regex for \fI--nth\fR and \fI--with-nth\fR (default: AWK-style)
.SS Search result
.TP
.B "+s, --no-sort"
Do not sort the result
.TP
.B "--tac"
Reverse the order of the input
.RS
e.g. \fBhistory | fzf --tac --no-sort\fR
.RE
.TP
.BI "--tiebreak=" "CRI"
Sort criterion to use when the scores are tied
.br
.R ""
.br
.BR length "  Prefers item with shorter length"
.br
.BR begin "   Prefers item with matched substring closer to the beginning"
.br
.BR end "     Prefers item with matched substring closer to the end"
.br
.BR index "   Prefers item that appeared earlier in the input stream"
.br
.SS Interface
.TP
.B "-m, --multi"
Enable multi-select with tab/shift-tab
.TP
.B "--ansi"
Enable processing of ANSI color codes
.TP
.B "--no-mouse"
Disable mouse
.TP
.B "--color=COL"
Color scheme: [dark|light|16|bw]
.br
(default: dark on 256-color terminal, otherwise 16)
.br
.R ""
.br
.BR dark "    Color scheme for dark 256-color terminal"
.br
.BR light "   Color scheme for light 256-color terminal"
.br
.BR 16 "      Color scheme for 16-color terminal"
.br
.BR bw "      No colors"
.br
.TP
.B "--black"
Use black background
.TP
.B "--reverse"
Reverse orientation
.TP
.B "--no-hscroll"
Disable horizontal scroll
.TP
.B "--inline-info"
Display finder info inline with the query
.TP
.BI "--prompt=" "STR"
Input prompt (default: '> ')
.SS Scripting
.TP
.BI "-q, --query=" "STR"
Start the finder with the given query
.TP
.B "-1, --select-1"
Automatically select the only match
.TP
.B "-0, --exit-0"
Exit immediately when there's no match
.TP
.BI "-f, --filter=" "STR"
Filter mode. Do not start interactive finder. When used with \fB--no-sort\fR,
fzf becomes a fuzzy-version of grep.
.TP
.B "--print-query"
Print query as the first line
.TP
.BI "--expect=" "KEY[,..]"
Comma-separated list of keys (\fIctrl-[a-z]\fR, \fIalt-[a-z]\fR, \fIf[1-4]\fR,
or any single character) that can be used to complete fzf in addition to the
default enter key. When this option is set, fzf will print the name of the key
pressed as the first line of its output (or as the second line if
\fB--print-query\fR is also used). The line will be empty if fzf is completed
with the default enter key.
.RS
e.g. \fBfzf --expect=ctrl-v,ctrl-t,alt-s,f1,f2,~,@\fR
.RE
.TP
.BI "--toggle-sort=" "KEY"
Key to toggle sort (\fIctrl-[a-z]\fR, \fIalt-[a-z]\fR, \fIf[1-4]\fR,
or any single character)
.TP
.B "--sync"
Synchronous search for multi-staged filtering. If specified, fzf will launch
ncurses finder only after the input stream is complete.
.RS
e.g. \fBfzf --multi | fzf --sync\fR
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND
Default command to use when input is tty
.TP
.B FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
Default options. e.g. \fB--extended --ansi\fR

.SH EXIT STATUS
.BR 0 "      Normal exit"
.br
.BR 1 "      Interrupted with \fBCTRL-C\fR or \fBESC\fR"

.SH FIELD INDEX EXPRESSION

A field index expression can be a non-zero integer or a range expression
([BEGIN]..[END]). \fI--nth\fR and \fI--with-nth\fR take a comma-separated list
of field index expressions.

.SS Examples
.BR 1 "      The 1st field"
.br
.BR 2 "      The 2nd field"
.br
.BR -1 "     The last field"
.br
.BR -2 "     The 2nd to last field"
.br
.BR 3..5 "   From the 3rd field to the 5th field"
.br
.BR 2.. "    From the 2nd field to the last field"
.br
.BR ..-3 "   From the 1st field to the 3rd to the last field"
.br
.BR .. "     All the fields"
.br

.SH EXTENDED SEARCH MODE

With \fI-x\fR or \fI--extended\fR option, fzf will start in "extended-search
mode". In this mode, you can specify multiple patterns delimited by spaces,
such as: \fB'wild ^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !rmx\fR

.SS Exact-match (quoted)
A term that is prefixed by a single-quote character (') is interpreted as an
"exact-match" (or "non-fuzzy") term. fzf will search for the exact occurrences
of the string.

.SS Anchored-match
A term can be prefixed by ^, or suffixed by $ to become an anchored-match term.
Then fzf will search for the items that start with or end with the given
string. An anchored-match term is also an exact-match term.

.SS Negation
If a term is prefixed by !, fzf will exclude the items that satisfy the term
from the result.

.SS Extended-exact mode
If you don't need fuzzy matching at all and do not wish to "quote" (prefixing
with ') every word, start fzf with \fI-e\fR or \fI--extended-exact\fR option
(instead of \fI-x\fR or \fI--extended\fR).
